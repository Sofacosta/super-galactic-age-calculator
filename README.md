## Notes
* I got confused on how to connect my local project folder into the Github Template repository. It took me a while to set up the project at the beginning but I found that in order to connect your local project folder to the most recent code from Github project the command is: [git pull](https://git-scm.com/docs/git-pull) 
* I got the same error than the beginning to the week were I hit npm install and Webpack keeps installing another version: webpack@5.20.2. The sollution that helped me was to uninstall webpack and install again: 
npm install webpack@4.39.3 --save-dev --save-exact
